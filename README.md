# Books-to-Scrape

In this mini project I scraped https://books.toscrape.com/ using Scrapy's CrawlSpider. I also spoofed my user agent in the request header to avoid getting blocked by some websites.

Python file path for CrawlSpider:
Books-to-Scrape > bookstoscrape > spiders > titles_ratings.py

JSON data path:
Books-to-Scrape > titles_ratings_data.json
